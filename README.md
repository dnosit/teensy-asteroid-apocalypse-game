# teensy-asteroid-apocalypse-game
This 'Asteroid Apocalypse' game was written for a custom Teensy Microcontroller, in an assignment for CAB202 at QUT (April, 2019). Written in C, it utilises some graphics libraries from the unit (not included here) and CPU cycles for timing. Source code was compiled into Hex before loading onto the Teensy.
